## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive Go SDK for Claude Agent, based on the Python SDK reference implementation (REQUIRED that you see ./claude-agent-sdk-python)
The Go SDK will provide idiomatic Go interfaces for interacting with Claude Code CLI, supporting both simple one-shot queries and complex bidirectional streaming conversations.
