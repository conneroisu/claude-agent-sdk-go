# Claude Agent SDK Go Plan – Evaluation

## Overall Takeaways
- The plan set is exhaustive and navigable, yet many sections paste prospective Go code instead of prescribing work, making sequencing and risk management opaque to implementers.
- Dependency and capability claims often contradict the current repository and Python reference, undermining confidence in feasibility (for example, zero-dependency promises vs. the actual module manifest).
- Cross-document consistency breaks down frequently—layering rules stated in the architecture summary are violated within phase write-ups, and success criteria misstate parity with the Python SDK.

## Document Grades
| File | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLAN/00_preamble.md` | B- | Clear orientation, but repeats the inaccurate “zero dependencies” framing. |
| `PLAN/01_executive_summary.md` | C+ | Strong scope overview offset by unrealistic metrics and dependency messaging. |
| `PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md` | D+ | Helpful diagrams but conflicted layering guidance and aspirational adapter behaviour. |
| `PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md` | D | Mostly finished code dumps, minimal guidance on sequencing or validation. |
| `PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md` | D | Reimplements large swaths of control flow in prose-code, ignoring adapter boundaries. |
| `PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md` | D+ | Detailed walkthrough but copies production code and omits operational failure modes. |
| `PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md` | D+ | Specifies wiring helpers that assume unimplemented types and hides error semantics. |
| `PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md` | D | API surface diverges from current Go work and leaves concurrency/error policy unresolved. |
| `PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md` | C | Captures desired UX, yet overstates in-memory transport support versus Python reality. |
| `PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md` | C | Accurate flow description but no persistence/testing strategy for permission updates. |
| `PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md` | C | Good end-to-end narrative, though examples rely on undefined types/functions. |
| `PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md` | C- | Sensible structure, undermined by broken snippets and missing CLI-testing guidance. |
| `PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md` | C- | Actionable checklist, but targets unreleased tooling versions and lacks artifact safeguards. |
| `PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md` | D+ | Lists outputs without owners, risks, or overlap guidance; little added value beyond TOC. |
| `PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md` | B- | Concise articulation of principles, though it omits known deviations. |
| `PLAN/12_success_criteria.md` | C | Verification ideas are ambitious yet misaligned with Python SDK capabilities. |
| `PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md` | C+ | Restates boundaries clearly, but conflicts with earlier phase write-ups. |
| `PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md` | B- | Captures lint regimen, missing practical guidance for necessary exceptions. |

## Detailed Feedback

### `PLAN/00_preamble.md` (B-)
- **Strengths:** Orientation and architectural framing make the packet approachable (`PLAN/00_preamble.md:5`, `PLAN/00_preamble.md:19`).
- **Issues:** Reiterates “Zero Dependencies” despite direct requirements in `go.mod` (`PLAN/00_preamble.md:40`, `go.mod:5`).
- **Suggestions:** Reword the dependency stance to “minimal external dependencies” and surface delivery guardrails (owners, review gates) so readers know how rigor is enforced.

### `PLAN/01_executive_summary.md` (C+)
- **Strengths:** Timeline and scope bullets set expectations quickly (`PLAN/01_executive_summary.md:7`, `PLAN/01_executive_summary.md:12`).
- **Issues:** The “Zero external dependencies” claim clashes with the module manifest (`PLAN/01_executive_summary.md:39`, `go.mod:5`), and promised latency/throughput targets lack supporting measurement plans (`PLAN/01_executive_summary.md:94`).
- **Suggestions:** Qualify dependency messaging and tie performance targets to concrete benchmarking tasks or risk them being ignored.

### `PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md` (D+)
- **Strengths:** Package map and control-protocol diagrams aid mental models (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:62`, `PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:171`).
- **Issues:** Still claims minimal dependencies while depending on MCP SDK (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:10`, `go.mod:5`), and timeout examples push control-flow back into the domain layer, contradicting its own adapter boundaries (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:307`, `PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md:63`). The in-memory MCP transport description does not match today’s manual routing in Python (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:408`, `claude-agent-sdk-python/src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/query.py:330`).
- **Suggestions:** Move timeout/request-ID handling back into the jsonrpc adapter plan and align MCP server expectations with the current Python workaround until the Go SDK offers true transport hooks.

### `PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md` (D)
- **Strengths:** Explains when to trade between typed structs and maps (`PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md:7`).
- **Issues:** The remainder is verbatim Go code, offering no sequencing or validation guidance (`PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md:24`, `PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md:192`). Error taxonomy promised in the TOC never materialises, leaving gaps for implementers.
- **Suggestions:** Replace the code dump with work items (e.g., “stub Message interfaces in messages/message.go, add table-driven parser tests”) and list open design questions (e.g., how to represent tool-result unions).

### `PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md` (D)
- **Strengths:** Opens with a clear depiction of control message flow (`PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:9`).
- **Issues:** Embeds implementation-ready code for ID generation and hook wiring, blurring the boundary with adapters and leaving concurrency policy undefined (`PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:72`, `PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:121`). The service loop still shells `map[string]any` without stating validation strategy (`PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:337`).
- **Suggestions:** Focus on responsibilities, sequencing, and test checkpoints (e.g., “mock transport failures trigger retries”) rather than prescribing code.

### `PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md` (D+)
- **Strengths:** Enumerates CLI command assembly steps and environment configuration (`PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md:78`).
- **Issues:** Copies nearly the entire transport implementation, yet omits Windows/path edge cases or CLI discovery fallbacks (`PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md:55`, `PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md:94`). Timeout/error propagation is not discussed, despite being critical for production diagnostics.
- **Suggestions:** Replace code listings with failure-mode analysis (e.g., CLI not found, stdout saturation) and outline observability hooks to catch them.

### `PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md` (D+)
- **Strengths:** Identifies the need for MCP initialisation helpers and facade wiring (`PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md:9`, `PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md:119`).
- **Issues:** Assumes types (`permissions.PermissionsConfig`, `options.MCPServerConfig`) that are not defined elsewhere in the plan and prescribes full function bodies (`PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md:44`, `PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md:187`). Error semantics (blocking vs. async, channel closure guarantees) remain undocumented.
- **Suggestions:** Document façade behaviours (e.g., does `Query` close channels on error?) and capture open questions about lifecycle management instead of embedding final code.

### `PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md` (D)
- **Strengths:** Re-exports domain hook types for users (`PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:20`).
- **Issues:** Introduces public helpers (`BlockBashPatternHook`) that depend on struct shapes not defined in earlier phases (`PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:42`, `PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:49`). Timeout handling and panic recovery are specified without clarifying default limits or user overrides (`PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:110`, `PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:132`).
- **Suggestions:** Align hook outputs with the Python `HookJSONOutput` contract (`claude-agent-sdk-python/src/claude_agent_sdk/types.py:118`) and document how hook execution timeouts interact with streaming cancellation.

### `PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md` (C)
- **Strengths:** Describes desired in-process MCP UX and tool registration generics clearly (`PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md:18`, `PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md:144`).
- **Issues:** Claims the Go SDK will provide channel-based in-memory transports, but Python currently hand-routes JSON-RPC without such support (`PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md:40`, `claude-agent-sdk-python/src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/query.py:326`). Error handling for misconfigured servers is not covered.
- **Suggestions:** Document interim limitations (e.g., manual routing similar to Python) and include tests for malformed MCP responses before promising transport abstractions.

### `PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md` (C)
- **Strengths:** Walks through control request payloads and responses clearly (`PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md:50`).
- **Issues:** Storage of updated permission rules is unspecified, so durability of user choices is unclear (`PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md:166`). No mention of integration tests to validate mode switching across sessions.
- **Suggestions:** Add acceptance criteria for persisting `PermissionUpdate` results and include coverage expectations for `set_permission_mode` flows.

### `PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md` (C)
- **Strengths:** Summarises how hooks, permissions, and MCP servers interplay (`PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md:8`, `PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md:54`).
- **Issues:** Example code references types like `hooking.HookInput` and `permissions.ResultAllow` that are never defined in earlier phases (`PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md:111`, `PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md:138`). Resource cleanup semantics for the combined scenario are absent.
- **Suggestions:** Replace the monolithic example with checklist-style validation steps and ensure referenced types exist or are clearly marked as future work.

### `PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md` (C-)
- **Strengths:** Encourages table-driven tests and adapter isolation (`PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md:5`, `PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md:74`).
- **Issues:** Sample code contains typographical errors (`PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md:58`) and never explains how to run CLI-dependent tests under restricted environments. SDK MCP adapter tests assume an in-memory transport that does not yet exist (`PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md:177`, `claude-agent-sdk-python/src/claude_agent_sdk/_internal/query.py:326`).
- **Suggestions:** Provide guidance for hermetic CLI testing (record/replay or fake transport) and fix the examples to highlight expected assertions.

### `PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md` (C-)
- **Strengths:** Concrete CI tasks and release checklist help operationalise delivery (`PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md:6`, `PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md:73`).
- **Issues:** Targets Go 1.25+ and multi-version CI even though 1.25 is not generally available yet (`PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md:14`). Release script pushes directly to main and tags without safeguards (`PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md:131`).
- **Suggestions:** Anchor tooling to the latest stable Go release and describe artifact verification/signing requirements before publishing.

### `PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md` (D+)
- **Strengths:** Captures dependency ordering across phases (`PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md:1`).
- **Issues:** Provides no staffing, overlap, or risk mitigation beyond restating deliverables (`PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md:55`, `PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md:128`). Acceptance gates require lint compliance that earlier phases have not prepared for (175-line limit with nothing on file splitting tactics).
- **Suggestions:** Add owners, checkpoints, and explicit mitigation strategies (e.g., mock transports unblock Phase 2). Reference the linting plan to explain feasibility.

### `PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md` (B-)
- **Strengths:** Summarises architectural principles succinctly (`PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md:1`).
- **Issues:** Ignores known exceptions such as control timeouts implemented in domain services (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:307`).
- **Suggestions:** Call out deliberate deviations so reviewers know which lint rules or architecture guardrails require enforcement exceptions.

### `PLAN/12_success_criteria.md` (C)
- **Strengths:** Enumerates coverage, performance, and documentation checkpoints (`PLAN/12_success_criteria.md:82`, `PLAN/12_success_criteria.md:107`).
- **Issues:** Lists nine hook events even though the Python SDK only supports six (`PLAN/12_success_criteria.md:13`, `claude-agent-sdk-python/src/claude_agent_sdk/types.py:110`). Performance targets repeat the 100ms/10k msg promises without instrumentation guidance (`PLAN/12_success_criteria.md:67`).
- **Suggestions:** Align parity goals with the actual Python feature set and add specific benchmark tasks or tooling to validate throughput claims.

### `PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md` (C+)
- **Strengths:** Depicts dependency directions and compile-time interface checks clearly (`PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md:5`, `PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md:108`).
- **Issues:** States all control protocol logic lives in adapters even though Phase 2 reintroduces it into domain services (`PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md:63`, `PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:120`).
- **Suggestions:** Either adjust Phase 2 to delegate control responsibilities or revise the summary to reflect the actual split.

### `PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md` (B-)
- **Strengths:** Thoroughly documents lint rules and their architectural implications (`PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md:17`, `PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md:128`).
- **Issues:** Provides no guidance on handling necessary exceptions (e.g., generated code, MCP schemas) or how to stage lint adoption across phases.
- **Suggestions:** Add escalation paths for legitimate exceptions and map specific lint checks to the implementation phases so teams can plan decomposition work.
