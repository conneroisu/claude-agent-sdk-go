# Claude Agent SDK Go Plan Evaluation

## Overall Notes
- The plan provides a thorough hexagonal architecture blueprint and mirrors the Python SDK goals described in `.claude/context/claude-agent-sdk-python.md` and `.claude/context/claude-agent-sdk-typescript.md`, but several implementation snippets contain inconsistencies that would block a direct build.
- Strengths cluster around architecture clarity (Phases 2–5), MCP integration (Phase 5b), and code-quality enforcement (Phase 14). Weak areas are release guidance (Phase 7), phase scheduling (Phase 10), and scant success metrics (Phase 12).
- Code samples frequently mix illustrative pseudo-code with real Go signatures. Flagged defects below should be reconciled before coding work begins to avoid propagating errors into the SDK.

## File-by-File Grades

### PLAN/00_preamble.md — Grade: A-
- Clear scope, architecture framing, and navigation of references across the plan.
- Mandates full plan adherence, though it could mention how parity with the Python SDK will be validated (see `.claude/context/claude-agent-sdk-python.md`).

### PLAN/01_executive_summary.md — Grade: C
- Extremely terse; repeats the intro from 00_preamble without success metrics, timelines, or highlights. Needs a sharper articulation of user value and differentiators.

### PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md — Grade: A
- Comprehensive package structure, dependency flow, and message taxonomy. Diagrams are useful and tie back to hexagonal goals.
- Consider cross-referencing concrete behaviors from the Python SDK (stream/event semantics) to reinforce parity claims.

### PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md — Grade: B
- Strong discussion of typed vs. dynamic structures; detailed model outlines.
- Several code samples would not compile as written (e.g., `strings.Join` on `[]options.BuiltinTool`, missing conversions) and should either be marked pseudo-code or corrected.

### PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md — Grade: B
- Good explanation of control protocol delegation and hook/permission flows.
- Domain service stubs include TODOs and omit concurrency/channel wiring details (e.g., how `querying.Service.Execute` drives message goroutines). Needs explicit parity checks against streaming behavior in the Python reference.

### PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md — Grade: B+
- Detailed CLI adapter lifecycle with environment wiring. Nice emphasis on discoverability and buffering.
- Same `strings.Join` issue as Phase 1; also no plan for stderr streaming versus logging, which is handled in the Python SDK.

### PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md — Grade: B
- Facade wiring mirrors Phase 2 abstractions and shows MCP initialization path.
- Contains TODOs for permission service setup and lacks lifecycle/error surface discussion (e.g., when channels close). Recommend bringing in learnings from `.claude/context/mcp-go.md` for MCP cleanup semantics.

### PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md — Grade: B
- Enumerates hook events and control flow clearly; useful helper example (`BlockBashPatternHook`).
- Hook matcher structure (`HookMatcher{Hooks: []hooking.HookCallback}`) diverges from Phase 2 definitions; needs reconciliation to avoid API drift.

### PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md — Grade: A-
- Excellent coverage of in-process vs. external MCP servers, generics usage, and transport flow. Aligns with `.claude/context/mcp-go.md` expectations.
- Minor concern: needs explicit error-handling guidance for server startup failures.

### PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md — Grade: B+
- Clear breakdown of control-request handling and permission modes.
- Would benefit from explicit examples of updating stored rules and ensuring suggestions propagate to persistent settings (mirroring Python behavior).

### PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md — Grade: B+
- Helpful consolidation plus E2E example.
- Example mixes placeholder hook signatures not defined elsewhere; ensure types match Phase 2/7a after reconciliation.

### PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md — Grade: B-
- Solid testing philosophy with mock guidance.
- Sample code contains typos (`ttt.setupMock`) and unimplemented mock interfaces. Needs concrete coverage targets mapped to Success Criteria.

### PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md — Grade: C-
- Focuses almost exclusively on linting enforcement; lacks module tagging, changelog strategy, release automation, or go-doc publication steps.

### PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md — Grade: C-
- Phase descriptions are overly terse and don’t reflect the granularity seen elsewhere. Lacks sequencing dependencies or entry/exit criteria.

### PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md — Grade: A-
- Concise articulation of the architectural rationale and Go idioms. Applies lessons from Python/TypeScript references effectively.

### PLAN/12_success_criteria.md — Grade: C+
- Lists high-level goals but no measurable checkpoints (e.g., definition of "functional parity" or documentation completeness). Should reference test matrices or sample acceptance tests.

### PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md — Grade: A-
- Reinforces dependency rules with helpful reiteration of compile-time contracts.
- Consider adding explicit guidance on how adapters are mocked in tests to connect back to Phase 6.

### PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md — Grade: A
- Exceptionally thorough capture of linting rules, architectural implications, and mitigation patterns. Sets realistic expectations for developers.

## Key Cross-Document Risks
- **API Inconsistencies:** Hook and permissions type signatures diverge between phases; reconcile before implementation begins.
- **Pseudo-code vs. Production Code:** Multiple snippets appear production-ready but contain compile errors. Either annotate as illustrative or fix to prevent confusion during coding.
- **Release/Test Gaps:** Phases 7, 10, and 12 need expansion to match the rigor of earlier phases; otherwise project exit criteria remain vague.

## Recommendations
1. Expand executive summary, release, and phase-overview docs with actionable milestones and success metrics.
2. Sweep all code listings for compilation issues and align with the strict lint constraints described in Phase 14.
3. Cross-reference Python/TypeScript implementations for lifecycle details (channel closure, MCP cleanup, permission persistence) to ensure parity claims are credible.
