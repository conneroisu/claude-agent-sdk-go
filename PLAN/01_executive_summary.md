## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a production-grade Go SDK for Claude Agent, delivering feature parity with the Python and TypeScript reference implementations while embracing Go idioms and best practices.

**Project Timeline:** 8-12 weeks for v0.1.0 release
**Target Users:** Go developers building AI agents, automation tools, and LLM-powered applications

### Scope & Deliverables

**Core Functionality:**
- One-shot query API (`claude.Query`) for simple, fire-and-forget operations
- Bidirectional streaming client (`claude.Client`) for interactive multi-turn conversations
- Full control protocol support (permissions, hooks, MCP integration, interrupts)
- Comprehensive message parsing and type-safe domain models

**Infrastructure Components:**
- CLI subprocess transport with stdin/stdout JSON-RPC communication
- Protocol adapter handling control requests/responses with 60s timeouts
- Message parser converting raw JSON to typed Go structs
- Hook system for PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and lifecycle events
- Permission callbacks with flexible allow/deny/ask modes
- MCP server support (stdio, HTTP, SSE transports + SDK-managed in-process servers)

**Developer Experience:**
- Clean hexagonal architecture separating domain logic from infrastructure
- Idiomatic Go APIs with context support, channels, and error handling
- Helper utilities for tool selection and system prompt construction
- Production examples demonstrating all major features
- Comprehensive godoc and usage documentation

### Key Differentiators

**Go-Native Design:**
- Leverages goroutines and channels for concurrent message handling
- Context-aware cancellation throughout the stack
- Compile-time type safety with discriminated unions via interfaces
- Zero external dependencies for core domain (stdlib only)
- Superior concurrency model compared to Python's async/await

**Architectural Discipline:**
- Strict hexagonal architecture with ports/adapters pattern
- Domain services never import infrastructure packages
- All infrastructure swappable via port interfaces
- Enforced via import linting (depguard) and package boundaries
- Enables testing without subprocesses or network I/O

**Quality & Maintainability:**
- golangci-lint enforcement (175-line file limit, cyclomatic complexity ≤15, cognitive complexity ≤20)
- Decomposed packages with single responsibilities
- >80% test coverage with table-driven unit tests
- CI/CD with automated linting, testing, and release workflows
- Stricter code quality standards than Python/TypeScript SDKs

**User Value Proposition:**
- Native Go types and idioms (no Python/TypeScript translations needed)
- Single static binary deployment (vs. Python virtualenvs or Node.js dependencies)
- Better resource efficiency for production workloads
- First-class MCP server support with type-safe generics
- Comprehensive examples mirroring Python SDK's reference implementations

### Implementation Approach

The SDK follows a **7-phase delivery plan** with clear milestones:

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Core domain models and port interfaces (foundation)
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4):** Domain services (querying, streaming, hooks, permissions)
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 4-6):** Infrastructure adapters (CLI, JSON-RPC, parser, MCP)
4. **Phase 4 (Week 7):** Public API facade and helper utilities
5. **Phase 5 (Week 8):** Advanced integrations (hooks, permissions, MCP)
6. **Phase 6 (Weeks 9-10):** Testing, documentation, and examples
7. **Phase 7 (Weeks 11-12):** Publishing, CI/CD, and release automation

Each phase includes:
- **Entry criteria:** Dependencies from prior phases complete
- **Exit criteria:** All tests passing, documentation complete, code review approved
- **Validation:** Integration tests verify parity with Python SDK behavior

### Success Metrics

**Functional Completeness:**
- ✅ 100% API parity with Python SDK v1.0 (verified via cross-SDK integration tests)
- ✅ All 18 builtin tools supported with correct parameter handling
- ✅ Streaming, hooks, permissions, and MCP working end-to-end

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Zero linting violations in CI (golangci-lint strict mode)
- ✅ ≥85% test coverage across domain and adapter layers (measured by go test -cover)
- ✅ All files ≤175 lines, all functions ≤25 lines (enforced by lll and funlen linters)
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity ≤15, cognitive complexity ≤20 (enforced by gocyclo and gocognit)

**Performance & Reliability:**
- ✅ Control protocol round-trip <100ms for local CLI subprocess
- ✅ Message parsing throughput >10,000 messages/sec
- ✅ Zero data races in race detector (go test -race)
- ✅ Memory-safe with no leaked goroutines (verified via leak detector)

**Documentation & Examples:**
- ✅ 8+ production-ready examples covering all major features
- ✅ README with quickstart achieving first query in <5 minutes
- ✅ pkg.go.dev documentation with 100% coverage of public APIs
- ✅ Migration guide from Python SDK with API equivalency table

**Release Readiness:**
- ✅ Published as versioned Go module (github.com/conneroisu/claude-agent-sdk-go)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and release tagging
- ✅ Semantic versioning with CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
