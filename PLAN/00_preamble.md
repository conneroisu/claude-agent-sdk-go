# Claude Agent SDK Go Implementation Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for a Go SDK for Claude Agent, providing idiomatic Go interfaces for interacting with Claude Code CLI. The SDK enables both simple one-shot queries and complex bidirectional streaming conversations with Claude.

### Purpose

The Claude Agent SDK for Go aims to:

- **Provide Go developers** with native, type-safe access to Claude's agentic capabilities
- **Follow Go conventions** using interfaces, channels, contexts, and explicit error handling
- **Support production use cases** including tool permissions, lifecycle hooks, and MCP server integration
- **Enable enterprise adoption** through clean architecture and comprehensive testing

### Architectural Approach

This SDK follows **hexagonal architecture** (ports and adapters pattern), which provides:

- **Domain Independence**: Core business logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Clear Boundaries**: Ports define contracts between domain and infrastructure
- **Testability**: Domain services can be tested without external dependencies
- **Flexibility**: Infrastructure implementations can be swapped without affecting business logic

The dependency flow is strictly enforced:
```
Public API → Adapters → Ports → Domain Services
```

The domain layer never imports from adapters, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Idiomatic Go**: Leverage Go's strengths (goroutines, channels, interfaces, contexts)
2. **Type Safety**: Use Go's strong typing with generics where appropriate
3. **Explicit Errors**: Follow Go's error handling patterns with clear error types
4. **Context Support**: Full `context.Context` integration for cancellation and timeouts
5. **Zero Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies where possible
6. **Package Naming**: Packages named for what they provide (`querying`, `streaming`) not what they contain (`models`, `handlers`)

### How to Use This Plan

This plan is organized into phases and supporting documents:

- **Read the Overview** (Executive Summary, Architecture) to understand the big picture
- **Follow the Phases** (1-7) for step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Reference Supporting Docs** for design decisions, success criteria, and architecture deep-dives

Each phase builds on the previous one, starting from core domain models and ending with publishing and CI/CD.
