## Linting Compliance Notes

### CI/CD Integration

**Critical: golangci-lint must be enforced in CI**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lint.yml
name: Lint
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  golangci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.23'
      - name: golangci-lint
        uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v4
        with:
          version: latest
          args: --timeout=5m
          # This will fail CI on ANY linting violation
```

**Pre-commit hooks:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
golangci-lint run --new-from-rev=HEAD~1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Linting failed. Fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```
