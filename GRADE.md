# Plan Grading

| Document | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PLAN/00_preamble.md | A | Clear intro, enforces architectural discipline, and sets expectations for using the rest of the plan without detectable gaps (`PLAN/00_preamble.md:1`). |
| PLAN/01_executive_summary.md | C | Too terse—does not surface the SDK scope, differentiators, or deliverables beyond two sentences, leaving stakeholders without actionable overview (`PLAN/01_executive_summary.md:1`). |
| PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md | B+ | Extremely detailed and aligned with hexagonal goals, but sheer volume and repeated diagrams make it hard to navigate quickly, slowing adoption despite solid technical direction (`PLAN/02_architecture_overview.md:3`). |
| PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md | B | Provides solid guidance on domain models vs maps with concrete examples, yet code snippets drift toward implementation instead of planning (risking duplication later) (`PLAN/03_phase_1_core_domain_ports.md:7`). |
| PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md | B- | Good explanation of control protocol responsibilities, but still missing explicit service responsibilities and leaves TODO-level ambiguities for permission handling (`PLAN/04_phase_2_domain_services.md:63`). |
| PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md | B | Rich adapter implementation detail and interface alignment, though it includes inline production-ready code that belongs in repo sources rather than planning narrative (`PLAN/05_phase_3_adapters_infrastructure.md:5`). |
| PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md | B- | Shows facade wiring clearly but includes unresolved TODOs (permissions initialization) and assumes helper functions like `initializeMCPServers()` without specification (`PLAN/06_phase_4_public_api_facade.md:32`). |
| PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md | B | Documents hook re-exports and lifecycle wiring well, yet example skews toward final code; could better emphasize sequencing and edge cases (`PLAN/07a_phase_5_hooks.md:18`). |
| PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md | A- | Strong coverage of in-process MCP integration, API surface, and flow; only minor nit is reliance on implied helper functions rather than fully scoped work items (`PLAN/07b_phase_5_mcp_servers.md:21`). |
| PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md | C+ | Describes desired behavior but defers entirely to Phase 2 for implementation specifics, leaving integrators without clear next tasks (`PLAN/07c_phase_5_permissions.md:28`). |
| PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md | B+ | Helpful synthesis and end-to-end example, though example code is verbose for a summary doc and obscures key checkpoints (`PLAN/07d_phase_5_integration_summary.md:56`). |
| PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md | B- | Lays out testing strategy with examples but sample code contains errors (e.g., `ttt.setupMock`) and lacks coverage goals mapping back to success criteria (`PLAN/08_phase_6_testing_documentation.md:41`). |
| PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md | C | Only high-level bullet points; needs actionable steps for module tagging, release cadence, and documentation updates beyond linting (`PLAN/09_phase_7_publishing_cicd.md:3`). |
| PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md | B | Concise overview of phase sequencing; could add dependencies and acceptance gates to guide execution (`PLAN/10_implementation_phases.md:2`). |
| PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md | A | Captures architectural principles and Go idioms succinctly with clear rationale, supporting consistent engineering decisions (`PLAN/11_key_design_decisions.md:1`). |
| PLAN/12_success_criteria.md | B | Defines measurable targets but would benefit from explicit linkage to verification methods for each criterion (`PLAN/12_success_criteria.md:1`). |
| PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md | A- | Excellent reiteration of dependency rules and compile-time guarantees, slightly verbose yet directly actionable (`PLAN/13_hexagonal_architecture_summary.md:3`). |
| PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md | A | Comprehensive coverage of enforced lint rules and architectural implications, providing actionable guidance for compliance (`PLAN/14_code_quality_and_linting_constraints.md:3`). |

**Key Follow-Ups**
1. Expand executive summary and Phase 7 sections with actionable deliverables and stakeholder messaging.
2. Replace inline implementation blocks with task-focused guidance where necessary (Phases 3–4).
3. Clarify outstanding TODOs (permissions wiring, helper function specs) so execution teams can proceed without guesswork.
