// Package clauderrs provides a comprehensive error handling framework for the
// Claude Agent SDK. This package defines error types, categories, and utilities
// to support consistent error handling across the SDK while maintaining
// backward compatibility.
//
// This file serves as the main entry point and re-exports all types and
// functions from the split files for backward compatibility.
package clauderrs

// All types, constants, and functions are directly available through the
// package files. The split was done to reduce file size and improve
// maintainability while preserving the same public API.

// For backward compatibility, all existing imports will continue to work
// exactly as before. Users can import specific types from their respective
// files if they want to reduce dependencies, but the main clauderrs package
// continues to provide everything as before.
